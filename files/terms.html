                    <p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set on a monthly basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription. Your acceptance of the VIP
                        savings club and initial discount enrolls you in a monthly membership plan.</p>
                    <p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or “the company” cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal by contacting “the company” customer support team via phone or email.</p>
                    <p>A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide “the company” with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize “the company” to charge all
                        Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.</p>
                    <p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, “the company” will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date,
                        with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.</p>
